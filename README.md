Hi, I'm Djessy! ðŸŒŸ

I'm diving into the world of web development and learning something new every day. I have some knowledge of Python and am passionate about all things tech. I love collaborating on projects and sharing knowledge with others.

In my free time, I'm a hot chocolate lover â˜• and an early bird ðŸŒ…, always ready to start the day with a fresh perspective.
